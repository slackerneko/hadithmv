# Styles Folder

This folder contains the core CSS files that define the project’s design system and styling structure.

## Files

* **`base.css`** – Stores design tokens such as colors, spacing, typography, utlilities and other reusable variables.
* **`main.css`** – Main stylesheet where designs are applied.
* **`reset.css`** – Normalizes default browser styles for consistency.

## Purpose

This structure ensures a clean separation of concerns and supports scalable, maintainable styling.
